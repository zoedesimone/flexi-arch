# Summary
The term “Flexibility” in architecture refers to the capability of a building to continuously alter its spatial arrangement to accommodate evolving demands. Architectural flexibility is a crucial aspect of creating sustainable built environments, yet there are limited tools to evaluate it during the design process. To fill this gap, we created a computational tool called “FlexiArch” that assesses the spatial Flexibility of residential floorplans. FlexiArch consolidates weighted Flexibility parameters identified from the research literature into 11 actionable performance indicators that are calculated within the Rhinoceros 3D & Grasshopper CAD environment. The tool provides immediate ratings without interrupting the design workflow, and it can be used as part of iterative and generative design processes. A validation study was conducted to compare 237 architects’ Flexibility ratings with FlexiArch outputs across five different floorplan designs, using a survey-based method. We found, somewhat surprisingly, that the aggregated human architects were unable to differentiate literature-based Flexibility features in the floorplans, rating all designs essentially the same. The computational approach, in contrast, demonstrated a much higher level of discrimination. These findings suggest that architectural designers may be insufficiently trained in understanding the importance of spatial Flexibility and how to achieve it. Tools such as FlexiArch can help fill this gap by providing robust quantitative feedback and encouraging designers to consider Flexibility issues. While more validation work is needed for FlexiArch, we conclude that such tools have an important role to play in expanding the current implementation repertoire of architectural sustainability analysis, potentially helping to reduce the frequency of demolition and new construction, the need for costly renovations, and the energy expenditure of occupant relocation.
