# Summary
Architectural flexibility is a crucial aspect of creating sustainable built environments, yet there are limited tools to evaluate it during the design process. This paper presents FlexiArch, a computational tool that assesses the flexibility of 3D residential architecture models during iterative and generative design. FlexiArch consolidates flexibility parameters from literature into 11 actionable flexibility performance indicators that are calculated within the Rhinoceros 3D & Grasshopper CAD environment. Upon connecting a 3D CAD model to FlexiArch, the tool outputs a flexibility score for each indicator and a total flexibility score for the floor plan to guide the design process towards flexible designs.

FlexiArch builds on a growing body of literature linking adaptable design to sustainability and presents a computational method to automatically calculate a building's design flexibility. A weighting system was developed through consultation with experts, drawing from an extensive literature review of flexibility assessment frameworks. The tool provides immediate ratings without interrupting the design workflow and without requiring any additional setup or surveys.

A survey was conducted to compare 237 architects' flexibility ratings with FlexiArch outputs across five floor plan designs. The computational approach demonstrated a much higher level of discrimination than the aggregated human architects who were unable to differentiate flexibility features, rating all designs essentially the same.

FlexiArch is a valuable tool that encourages designers to consider building longevity and adaptability in their creative and analytical processes. It expands the current implementation repertoire of architectural sustainability analysis and can help reduce the frequency of demolition and new construction, the need for costly renovations, and the energetic expenditure of occupant relocation. As a computational tool that accepts working design plans as its input, FlexiArch can facilitate flexible designs without interrupting the design workflow, potentially making sustainable design more accessible and feasible for architects.
